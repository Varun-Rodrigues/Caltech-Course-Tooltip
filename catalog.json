Every student will build a microscope from scratch, use a confocal microscope to measure transcription in living fly embryos and perform a quantitative dissection of gene expression in bacteria. Students will then use Python to write computer code to analyze the results of all of these experiments. No previous experience in coding is presumed, though for those with previous coding experience, advanced projects will be available. In addition to the experimental thrusts, students will use \"street fighting mathematics\" to perform order of magnitude estimates on problems ranging from how many photons it takes to make a cyanobacterium to the forces that can be applied by cytoskeletal filaments. These modeling efforts will be complemented by the development of physical models of phenomena such as gene expression, phase separation in nuclei, and cytoskeletal polymerization. Graded pass/fail",

        "description": "g. ACM 105 and ACM 116 is desired. Measure transport is a rich mathematical topic at the intersection of analysis, probability and optimization. The core idea behind this theory is to rearrange the mass of a reference measure to match a target measure. In particular, optimal transport seeks a rearrangement that transports mass with minimal cost. The theory of optimal transport dates back to Monge in 1781, with significant advancements by Kantorovich in 1942 and later in the '90s, e.g. by Brenier. In recent years, measure transport has become an indispensable tool for representing probability distributions and for defining measures of similarity between distributions. These methods enjoy applications in image retrieval, signal and image representation, inverse problems, cancer detection, texture and color modelling, shape and image registration, and machine learning, to name a few. This class will introduce the foundations of measure transport, present its connections and applications in various fields, and lastly explore modern computational methods for finding discrete and continuous transport maps, e.g. Sinkhorn's algorithm and normalizing flows.

In theoretical systems, it requires modelling by stochastic differential equations, whose solutions can be analytically intractable except for the simplest of Gaussian processes. Research on classical and quantum systems has revealed, however, that noise is essential when boosting hidden signatures by the phenomenon known as stochastic resonance. Many different methods proposed for inducing stochastic resonance are now revolutionizing measurement and modeling in fields as wide ranging as nonlinear optics and photonics, quantum communication, SQUID devices, neurophysiology, hydrodynamics, climate research and finance.

The format centers on projects and practical skills but also includes a lecture and problem set component to establish the theoretical underpinnings of the practical work. Specific course components include: (a) Students will learn to use small, portable telescopes and find and image objects of interest using finder charts; (b) Students will build basic data reduction pipelines for imaging and spectroscopy data to understand how these types of data are used to derive scientific results; (c) Students will use Palomar Observatory to propose and execute their own research projects focused on astrophysical or planetary topics; (d) Students will query and work with data from on-line archives and catalogs. The class meets twice a week during the daytime plus one weekly evening telescope session, and has a required field trip to Palomar Observatory. Students interested in enrolling should review the logistical information on this page and ensure their schedule allows attendance of all course components prior to registering: https://dekleer.caltech.edu/ayge107.

Evolutionary mechanisms acting at different scales of biological organization will be covered, including gene and protein evolution, gene family and genome evolution, cell type evolution, the evolution of developmental processes controlling morphology, neural circuit evolution and behavior, the molecular mechanisms that physiologically adapt organisms to their environments, and the origins of ecological relationships between species. At each scale, constraints and catalysts on the evolutionary process will be discussed that have led to the spectrum of living systems comprising our planet's tree of life.

We are bombarded by biological threats from the outside, ranging from toxic particulates to epidemic viruses, and also by threats from within, like cancer. How do our bodies manage to be victorious against these threats for so many years, in most cases? Many people have some familiarity with aspects of the answers now, due to COVID-19. But how can these defense mechanisms actually work, and how can they coordinate their actions to be effective and safe? Why do they fail? This course will zoom between scales to introduce the cells that the body uses for immune defense and how they execute their roles, both system-wide and at the molecular level. A central theme will be how the system is controlled by cellular \"software\" reading the genetic code, by ultra-rapid evolutionary mechanisms, and by elegant cell-cell communication networks.

Due to the development of new technologies in the 21st century, experimental and computational tools, such as the sequencing of nucleic acids, have become faster and more inexpensive. These new tools have allowed the biological sciences to use genetics and genomics to reveal the functional relationships of life forms across the biosphere as never before. The largest conceptual shift enabled by this new capacity is the discovery of the unexpected complexity of the invisible world of microbes. We have learned that their diversity dwarfs that of animals and plants, and that they underlie the health of all corners of the biosphere and its inhabitants. In addition, genomic analyses of microbes have revealed that they 'invented' almost every fundamental feature of biological systems, and that macroorganisms have primarily added nuances as they build upon these essential foundations. This course aims to provide students with a comprehensive view of the structure and function of the biosphere, from its evolutionary history to its molecular underpinnings and emergent ecological patterns. The integration of micro- and macrobiology in an introductory biology course will allow students to both focus on the fundamental principles driving life and to build a comprehensive conceptual framework for understanding biology, much as chemistry and physics did in the 20th century as they developed a long-lasting framework for their introductory courses",

Development from embryos and development from stem cells are distinct paradigms for understanding and manipulating the emergence of ordered biological complexity from simplicity. This course focuses on the distinguishing features of stem-cell based systems, ranging from the natural physiological stem cells that are responsible for life-long hematopoiesis in vertebrates (hematopoietic stem cells) to the artificial stem cells, ES and iPS cells, that have now been created for experimental manipulation. Key questions will be how the stem cells encode multipotency, how they can enter long-term self-renewal by separating themselves from the developmental clock that controls development of the rest of the organism, and how the self-renewal programs of different stem cell types can be dismantled again to allow differentiation. Does \"stem-ness\" have common elements in different systems? The course will also cover the lineage relationships among diverse differentiated cell types emerging from common stem cells, the role of cytokines and cytokine receptors in shaping differentiation output, apoptosis and lineage-specific proliferation, and how differentiation works at the level of gene regulation and regulatory networks.

Emotions aid us in decision-making (gut feelings), help us remember, torment us, yet have ultimately helped us to survive. Over the past few decades, we have begun to characterize the neural systems that extend from primitive affective response such as fight or flight to the complex emotions experienced by humans including guilt, envy, empathy and social pain. This course will begin with an in-depth examination of the neurobiological systems that underlie negative and positive emotions and move onto weekly discussions, based on assigned journal articles that highlight both rudimentary and complex emotions. The final weeks will be devoted to exploring how the neurobiological systems are disrupted in affective disorders including anxiety, aggression and psychopathy. In addition to these discussions and readings, each student will be required to write a review paper or produce a short movie on a topic related to one of the emotions discussed in these seminars and its underlying neural mechanisms",

The leptokurtic (fat-tailed) nature of financial data and approaches to modeling financial surprises are covered, leading to inherently leptokurtic techniques for estimating volatility and correlation. Scenario analysis, and regime-switching methods are shown to provide ways of dealing with risk in extreme environments. The special nature of modeling long/short portfolios (hedge funds) is explored.

Behavioral finance is a large and active field that develops and studies models in which some agents are less than fully rational. Such models have two building blocks: limits to arbitrage, which makes it difficult for rational traders to undo the dislocations caused by less rational traders; and psychology, which provides guidance for the kinds of deviations from full rationality we might expect to see. We discuss these two topics and consider a number of applications: asset pricing; individual trading behavior; the origin of bubbles; and financial crises. Not offered 2025-26",

The first 5 weeks of Ch 121a covers the basic methods of QM and MD with hands-on applications to systems using modern software. For the midterm each student proposes a short research project to use atomistic simulations for a problem that has not yet been published. For the second 5 weeks of Ch 121a each student addresses this research project with a weekly 5-10 min presentation on progress. The final is a 5 page report on the results. In Ch 121b each student selects a more extensive research project (could be an extension of the Ch 121a project) and uses atomistic simulations to solve it.

        "description": "This class treats Shannon's mathematical theory of communication and the tools used to derive and understand it. The class is organized around fundamental questions and their solutions, leading to central results such as Shannon's source coding, channel coding, and rate-distortion theorems. Quantities that arise en route to these solutions include entropy, relative entropy, and mutual information for discrete and continuous random variables. The course explores the calculation of fundamental communication limits like entropy rate, capacity, and rate-distortion functions under a variety of source and communication channel models (e.g., memoryless, Markov, ergodic, and Gaussian). The course begins with a foundational discussion of the simplest communication scenarios and then expands to include topics like universal source coding, the role of side information in source coding and communications, and the generalization of earlier results to network systems. Network information theory topics include multiuser data compression and communication over multiple access channels, broadcast channels, and multiterminal networks. Philosophical and practical implications of the theory are also explored. This course, when combined with EE 112, EE/Ma/CS/IDS 127, EE/CS 161, and EE/CS/IDS 167, should prepare the student for research in information theory, coding theory, wireless communications, and/or data compression.

It then introduces a basic theory of stochastic optimization when problem parameters are uncertain, covering robust optimization, chance constrained optimization, scenario optimization, and two-stage power flow problem that underlies numerous power system applications. Familiarity with linear algebra and real analysis is required. Previous exposure to smooth convex optimization will be helpful but not necessary",

In this course, we will study this emerging multi-disciplinary field at the intersection of signal processing, applied optics, computer graphics, and vision. At the start of the course, we will study modern image processing and image editing pipelines, including those encountered on DSLR cameras and mobile phones. Then we will study the physical and computational aspects of tasks such as coded photography, light-field imaging, astronomical imaging, medical imaging, and time-of-flight cameras. The course has a strong hands-on component, in the form of homework assignments and a final project. In the homework assignments, students will have the opportunity to implement many of the techniques covered in the class. Example homework assignments include building an end-to-end HDR (High Dynamic Range) imaging pipeline, implementing Poisson image editing, refocusing a light-field image, and making your own lensless \"scotch-tape\" camera",

In this course we will examine behavioral economics models in several key decision-making contexts: choice over time, choice under uncertainty, choice in market settings (i.e., buying and selling), and others. In each topic area we will begin by providing the standard neoclassical account for behavior, building from assumptions (axioms) to corresponding utility models. We will then ask whether critical axioms of neoclassical models are plausible by calling upon psychological insights and empirical data. Rejection of neoclassical axioms will lead to new models, behavioral economics models, in each setting. These models, mechanisms and their testable predictions will be discussed",

This first part delves into Consumer Choice Theory, where students will explore how individuals make consumption decisions based on their preferences, budget constraints, and the theory of utility maximization. Through a series of lectures and exercises, participants will learn to model consumer behavior and study how changes in market conditions affect consumer demand. Simultaneously, the course will cover Firm Theory, examining how firms make production and pricing decisions to maximize profits in competitive and non-competitive markets. Students will be introduced to the concepts of production functions, cost minimization, and profit maximization, alongside the analysis of market structures and their impact on firm behavior. This dual focus provides a comprehensive foundation for understanding the interactions between consumers and firms, setting the stage for more complex discussions on market equilibria, welfare economics, and policy implications in later parts of the course (Ec 121b). Through a blend of theoretical models and real-world applications, this course aims to develop critical thinking and analytical skills, preparing students for advanced studies in economics or careers equilibrium",

Building on the foundational knowledge acquired in the first part of the Advanced General Equilibrium course (Ec 121a), this second half of the course ventures into the study of Partial Equilibrium Analysis, Welfare Theorems, and Market Failures. Students will engage with Partial Equilibrium Analysis to understand the equilibrium conditions of specific markets in isolation, appreciating how changes in supply and demand in one market can impact prices and quantities without considering the economy-wide effects. This segment sets the groundwork for a deeper exploration of economic efficiency and resource allocation through a blend of theoretical insights and case studies. Then the course explores the First and Second Welfare Theorems, highlighting how, under ideal conditions, markets can achieve optimal social outcomes. The First Welfare Theorem shows that competitive markets lead to Pareto efficiency, where improving one's situation without harming another is impossible. The Second Theorem suggests that any Pareto efficient outcome can be reached through market equilibrium with correct resource distribution. However, real-world deviations such as monopolies, public goods, and externalities are examined to understand market failures and the potential for government intervention to enhance social welfare. This section equips students with the tools to evaluate economic policies, their efficiency, and their impact on society",

European literature has long been a testing ground for radical new ideas which have come to shape our basic understanding of what it means to be a thinking, speaking and perhaps even autonomous human being. The question of what - if anything - makes us different from animals was debated from numerous points of view: including talking dogs, philosophizing women, bestial men, humanlike beasts, and other creatures that defied the conventions of the time. This course explores some of the key literary texts that shaped this debate and pays careful attention to their cultural environments.

The course will emphasize the influence of new technologies on modernist representations of time and space, including rural and urban space, and modernism's engagement with changing attitudes regarding race, gender and sexuality. Students will learn about key movements within American modernism, including the Harlem Renaissance, and may opt to analyze modernist literature's relationships to other genres, including music and visual culture.

How do we understand technology? How do we define technological invention? How does technological innovation circulate? This course explores major technological achievements across different historical contexts, with a particular focus on the Mediterranean world between the 14th and 17th centuries. It also examines processes of technological transfer among Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Americas. We will investigate how technological innovations emerged, circulated, interacted, and shaped societies-as well as new ideas in science. Analyzing the concept of invention will be especially useful in critically assessing traditional narratives of rupture-such as the Renaissance and the Scientific Revolution-as well as narratives of continuity in the development of scientific knowledge and technology.

Since then, American labor has been a key arena in which racial division and solidarity have been experienced and negotiated. How did racial hierarchies structure the everyday encounters and struggles of American workers? How did literary writers make sense of these tensions while imagining political alternatives? This class will provide a historical overview of how the interplay between race and labor was contested in 20th-century American literature. Authors covered may include Claude McKay, H. T. Tsiang, Muriel Rukeyser, Carlos Bulosan, and Gwendolyn Brooks",

However, a researcher's experience of inquiry is often deeply personal and emotional, and some researchers choose to write about those experiences in personal essays and memoirs. We will analyze a wide variety of this narrative writing, and we will examine connections between the narratives' formal features and the rhetorical effects they might have on readers. Drawing on what we learn, students will compose an excerpt of their own memoir or a stand-alone personal narrative essay.

In the 1855 edition of Leaves of Grass, Walt Whitman claimed that \"the United States themselves are essentially the greatest poem.\" We might ask any number of questions in response to Whitman. If the United States are a poem, then who wrote it? What is this poem about? What genre is it? Is anyone reading it? Is it actually any good? Though we might approach Whitman's statement with some apprehension from our historical moment, this course will take seriously American life lived within poetry and the lives poems lived across the country. Together, we will track the development of American poetry as it engages with enslavement, abolition, genocide, war, beauty, nature, racialization, constructions of gender, sexuality, and affect. Ultimately, we will ask what reading nineteenth-century American poetry, or nineteenth-century America as a poem, might mean for our understanding of the country today. Readings may include Bryant, Poe, Longfellow, Schoolcraft (Bamewawagezhikaquay), Whitman, Dickinson, Harper, Dunbar, and Noguchi. Not offered 2025-26",

Women in ancient epic begin as prizes of honor for male warriors and become powerful witches and queens, while some contemporary women writers allow their ancient heroines to speak in their own voices. From Homer to the present, epic narratives also traverse continents as they narrate the founding and foundering of empires historical and imaginary. This course introduces students to key classical epics while exploring historical and contemporary adaptations from Dante's Divine Comedy to Madeline Miller's Circe . By examining the afterlives of epic, we will consider how the genre changes when taken up by the gender typically marginalized in the classical tradition. Possible authors include Homer, Apollonius of Rhodes, Virgil, Ovid, Dante, Christa Wolf, Ursula K. Le Guin, Madeline Miller, and Mar\u00eda Baranda. Not offered 2025-26",

Starting in the early 1950s, the New York School of poets challenged the stuffy orthodoxy of mid-century American poetry by adopting the experimental tactics of European avant-garde movements such as Dadaism and Surrealism. This course offers a critical exploration of this influential group's varied body of work, with special attention to its extensive connections to the visual arts. Throughout the course, we will think about the New York School's activities in the context of Cold War American culture, emergent forms of queer sociality, and the rapidly changing urban environment of postwar Manhattan.

This course will take an historical approach to the relationship between literature and photography by examining what Douglass refers to as the contrast between \"picture\" and \"fact\" from the advent of photography in the nineteenth century to our present moment. Together, we will think about how each medium creates images, invites different ways of reading or viewing, and makes forms of individual, collective, and political representation possible. We will also examine the ways in which photography and literature shape our understanding of temporality, truth, memory, and history. In addition to our experience of literary and photographic works, theoretical texts on photography will inform the ways of reading and ways of seeing we will develop in this course.

In this course, we will investigate both the London Dickens knew, and the portrait of the city that he painted, by reading one of Dickens's great mid-career novels alongside a selection of contemporary texts and images and secondary historical sources. We will think about the gap-or overlap- between history and fiction, the idea of the novelist as alternative historian, and the idea of the novel as historical document. Historical topics covered may include: the development of the Victorian police force; plague and public health; Victorian poverty; colonialism and imperialism; Dickens and his illustrators; Victorian exhibition and museum culture; and marriage and the cult of domesticity, among others. Students will practice both textual and visual analysis skills. In addition to written work, students should expect to be responsible for making a short research presentation at some point in the term. Not offered 2025-26",

How is that tradition inextricable from American literary history? From slave narratives to Toni Morrison's Beloved, from the Harlem Renaissance to Alice Walker, from Ralph Ellison to Walter Mosley, African American literature has examined topics as diverse and important as race relations, class identification, and family life.

This is a disconnected, strange, and violent poem, which raises the excellent question how it could become a widely revered classic down to our own time. To look for answers--answers that perhaps also apply to any \"classic\" book-- we will go on to study the acts of interpretation, revision, and recycling that made the 'Iliad' fresh and different, sometimes virtually unrecognizable, for each new generation of readers. We survey surprising ancient Greek philosophical interpretations, a medieval romance by Geoffrey Chaucer set in ancient Troy, a fake Scottish epic poem allegedly composed by \"Ossian,\" Chuck Palahniuk's novel 'Fight Club' (1996), and other works.

In the years following World War II, an unprecedented number of African American writers and artists moved to Paris and Rome, many seeking greater personal liberties and a refuge from racial discrimination at home.

We will analyze postwar African American expatriate writing's unique and often critical perspectives regarding American society and culture and identify the literary strategies that writers used to address the changing times, promote social justice, and advance new narrative forms, often by crossing traditional boundaries of genre and nation.

In the decades following the second-wave feminist movement, a body of writing necessitated the creation of \"Black feminist criticism\" and \"queer of color critique.\" It was a moment in which Black people across identities and national origins wrote several works that radically retheorized family, home, gender, love, race, sexuality, work, and more, in ways that challenged cultures of violence in favor of imagining beloved communities.

How did the new nation identify citizens when its Constitution seemed so silent on the matter? And how did one tailor's pamphlet result in one of most massive restrictions of free speech in U.S. history? Our goal over the semester will be to sketch a story of African American literary production from the latter half of the eighteenth century to the Civil War and to tease out, through this literature, developing understandings of citizenship in the United States. We will read letters, poems, sermons, songs, constitutions and bylaws, short stories, and texts that simply defy easy categorization. We will also spend several sessions becoming familiar with key newspapers and magazines-Freedom's Journal, Frederick Douglass's Paper, The Anglo-African Magazine, Christian Recorder, and The Crisis-to deepen our understanding of the kinds of things people were reading and writing on a regular basis and the kinds of arguments they were making. Writers up for discussion may include: Frederick Douglass, James Madison, Harriet Jacobs, Henry David Thoreau, Sojourner Truth, and David Walker. Not offered 2025-26",

This result of the Industrial Revolution produced many effects, but in the fiction of the period, one of the most striking was an obsession with the problem of crime. Victorian authors filled their novels with murder, prisons, poisonings, prostitution, criminals, and the new figure of the detective; in this class we will look at the social history, publishing developments, and formal dilemmas that underlay such a response.

This course will introduce you to some better-known and lesser-known works in the Chaucerian corpus, while also exploring questions central to the production and circulation of literature in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. What did it mean to \"invent\" a literary work in late medieval England? How did Chaucer imagine himself as a writer and reader? What are the hallmarks of Chaucerian style, and how did Chaucer become the canonical author he is today? We will read Chaucer's works in their original language, Middle English, working slowly enough to give participants time to familiarize themselves with syntax and spelling.

Studies Cervantes's literary masterpiece, Don Quixote, with a view to the great upheavals that shaped the early modern world: Renaissance Europe's discovery of America; feudalism's demise and the rise of mass poverty; Reformation and Counter-Reformation; extermination of heretics and war against infidels; and the decline of the Hapsburg dynasty. The hapless protagonist of Don Quixote calls into question the boundaries between sanity and madness, truth and falsehood, history and fiction, objectivity and individual experience.

In this course, we take a broad look at this question and consider virtual reality from various historical perspectives (including Plato's Cave Allegory, Descartes' Meditations, and Calderon's Life is a Dream) before focusing on more recent literary approaches within the context of the rapidly changing technological environment.

These include pumping carbon dioxide into geologic reservoirs or ultramafic rocks, stimulating biospheric growth, enhanced mineral weathering, soil carbon accumulation, biomass burial on land or at sea, and others. We will examine these strategies in detail, looking at both the science and technology that enable them to work, as well as their potential biogeochemical ramifications for Earth's global systems if pursued at scale. The class is structured as a tutorial, in which small groups of students meet individually with the instructor, and topics are presented by the students. Each student will write papers, give presentations, and lead discussions on 3 topics throughout the term. Course will be limited to 12 participants, who will be selected at the start to the entire term. Undergrads only. Fulfills the Institute scientific writing requirement",

Looking East/Looking West. 9 units (3-0-6); For course description, see Visual Culture H 107. The Early Middle Ages. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. This course is designed to introduce students to the formative period of Western medieval history, from roughly 300 to 1000 CE. It will emphasize the development of a new civilization from the fusion of Roman, Germanic, and Christian traditions, with a focus on the Frankish world. The course focuses on the reading, analysis, and discussion of primary sources. Instructor: Brown. H 108. The High Middle Ages. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. This course is designed to introduce students to European history between 1000 and 1400. It will provide a topical as well as chronological examination of the economic, social, political, and religious evolution of western Europe during this period, with a focus on France, Italy, England, and Germany. The course emphasizes the reading, analysis, and discussion of primary sources. Instructor: Brown. H 109. Medieval Knighthood. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. This course tells the story of the knight from his beginnings in the early Middle Ages, through his zenith in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries, to his decline and transformation in the late medieval and early modern periods. The course treats the knight not simply as a military phenomenon but also as a social, political, religious, and cultural figure who personified many of the elements that set the Middle Ages apart. Not offered 2025-26. H 110. Environment and Empire in the Early Modern Atlantic World. 9 units (3-0-6); first. According to earth scientists, European colonization of the Americas constituted an ecological disaster of global proportions. The environmental impact of colonization, however, was experienced at every scale as new people, animals, plants, and microbes collided in unprecedented and unanticipated ways. This course will explore all of these scales and introduce students to both the field of environmental history and to the Atlantic World, a term used by scholars to describe interactions between Europeans, Africans, and Americans from the fifteenth to the nineteenth century. The major themes of this course will be the exploration and exploitation of the natural world by Europeans, the creation of knowledge about the natural world, the use of environment as a tool of resistance by enslaved Africans and Indigenous peoples and changing views of the natural world throughout the early modern period. Not offered 2025-26. . H 111. The Medieval Church. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. This course takes students through the history of the medieval Christian Church in Europe, from its roots in Roman Palestine, through the zenith of its power in the high Middle Ages, to its decline on the eve of the Reformation. The course focuses on the church less as a religion (although it will by necessity deal with some basic theology) than as an institution that came to have an enormous political, social, cultural, and economic impact on medieval life, and for a brief time made Rome once more the mistress of Europe. Not offered 2025-26. H 112. The Vikings. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. This course will take on the Scandinavian seafaring warriors of the 8th-11th centuries as a historical problem. What were the Vikings, where did they come from, and how they did they differ from the Scandinavian and north German pirates and raiders who preceded them? Were they really the horned-helmeted, bloodthirsty barbarians depicted by modern popular their roughly two centuries of raiding and colonization on the civilizations of medieval and ultimately modern Europe? Not offered 2025-26. H 113. Books, Readers, and Science in Early Modern Europe. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. This course introduces topics and methods in the history of the book and reading. It focuses on the representation of knowledge in early modern printed materials across contemporary disciplines, which include natural history, technical arts, geography, music, and philology. We will examine in detail how scholars, editors, and printers translated new discoveries in sciences and humanities to text and images, thus learning about the communication and reception of knowledge in early modern Europe. We will study books, maps, and broadsheets, asking questions about the advantages and limits of print as a method of knowledge dissemination as well as the objectivity of the representation of research findings. The course focuses on the period between 1500-1800, with a final foray into the nineteenth and twentieth century to investigate the development and characteristics of scientific photography. Instructor: Falkowski. H 114. Native North America. 9 units (3-0-6); first, second terms. North America is populated by a multitude of Indigenous peoples who have shaped the cultures, politics, and environments here since time immemorial. Indigenous nations moreover controlled the vast majority of North America until at least the middle of the nineteenth century. Today, there are 574 federally recognized Native American tribes, each with a unique culture and history, making it impossible to fit all of Native American history into a single narrative. As a result, this course explores different episodes within a larger period of rapid change in Native American history: the period between the fifteenth and nineteenth centuries. This course will explore both how selected nations responded and adapted to larger changes happening across North America and critical themes and concepts within Native and Indigenous Studies. Students will also be asked to connect what they are learning to current events involving Indigenous people. Instructor: Jones. H 115. Instruments of Knowledge from Antiquity to the Early Modern World. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. This course examines the development of scientific instruments from Antiquity to the Early Modern period, with a particular focus on the Euro-Mediterranean region. Students will explore questions such as: What defines a scientific instrument? How did science shape scientific instruments, and how did scientific instruments, in turn, shape science? The course will investigate how instruments emerged, interacted, and contributed to evolving scientific paradigms. Special attention will be given to the unexpected role played by now-obsolete scientific traditions-ranging from alchemy and astrology to Aristotelian meteorology-in influencing the design and function of some of the most revolutionary scientific instruments in history. A key component of the course will be hands-on learning: students will analyze and reconstruct historical instruments using replicas and digital tools, including 3D-printed models, and visit museum, library, and archive collections. Instructor: Zanetti. H 116. Tying the Knot: Marriage in the Medieval Christian and Islamic Worlds. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. This course examines the meaning, practice, and religious significance of marriage in both the Christian and Islamic worlds during the Middle Ages. It focuses on the diverse religious, cultural, and social meanings of marriage as expressed in literary texts like hagiographies and histories, as well as the contested legal and doctrinal aspects of matrimony argued over by lawyers, jurists, and theologians. Particular attention will be paid to analysis of archival legal sources like marriage contracts and disputes which shed light on marriage practices, gender dynamics, and family relationships in the medieval world. Instructor: Morgan. H 117. Laying Down the Law: Legal Culture in the Medieval Mediterranean, c. 530-1230. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. Medieval law can seem strange from a modern perspective. Why was trial by battle acceptable? Why were forgery and murder both crimes punishable by death? How did religion impact law? The strangeness of medieval law reminds us that our ways of thinking about the law-our assumptions about why it exists and how it should work-are conditioned by our contemporary cultural and social values. In this course we will examine the diverse legal traditions of the medieval Mediterranean-European, Byzantine, and Islamicate law-to better understand law as a dynamic aspect of medieval societies and cultures. The course will introduce students to the methodology and theory of legal history and encourage them to consider from this perspective the political, social, and cultural factors which influence our modern attitudes towards law. Instructor: Morgan. H 123. Ordinary People: Uncovering Everyday Life in the European Past. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. In the historical record, much attention is given to wealthy elites (rulers and lawmakers, aristocrats, wealthy merchants), since they were the ones who left written records of their political and economic activities and their personal affairs. But what about the vast majority of people who lived in the past, most of whom were barely literate and had little opportunity to 'make history'? What can we know about them? This class focuses on the lives of ordinary people, and the sources historians use to learn about them. Special attention will be given to women, the poor, and other marginalized groups in societies ranging from England in the west to Russia in the east. Not offered 2025-26. H 124. Russia. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. Current events have us looking to the past for explanations. How does Russian history help us to understand what is happening in Russia today? Contemporary political commentary emphasizes the recent past: the history of the Soviet Union and its collapse in 1991. This course takes a longer look at Russian political, economic, social, and cultural history - from imperial Russia to the present day. The emphasis is on longer continuities over eras: tsarist, Soviet, post-Soviet. Topics covered include the nature and role of the inequality, art and social commentary, popular resistance, censorship, and the effects of all of these on the lives of ordinary Russians. Not offered 2025-26. H 125. Soviet Russia. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. Why was the Russian Revolution of 1917 successful? And how did the Soviet system survive nearly 75 years? These questions will be addressed in the wider context of Russian history, with a focus on political, economic, and social institutions in the pre- and post-revolutionary period. Subjects covered include the ideological underpinnings of Bolshevism, Lenin and the Bolshevik coup, the rise of Stalin, collectivization, socialist realism, the command economy, World War II, the Krushchev 'thaw', dissident culture and the arts, popular culture, and Gorbachev's perestroika. A variety of sources will be used, including secondary historical literature, fiction, film, and art. Not offered 2025-26. H/HPS 129. History of Satellites: From Sputnik to Starlink. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. The artificial satellites encircling the planet make up a global information infrastructure. Most of us living in industrialized regions use satellites daily without even realizing it. How did satellites become so integral to terrestrial technological systems? How did Earth orbit transform from a wilderness into a landscape during the second half of the 20th century, and how is that landscape changing in the 21st? We will trace the history of satellites beginning with the first artificial \"moons\" and moving into the current moment of private industry ascendance, taking into account the development, use, and decay of these technologies. We will consider how designers and users shape satellites, and map out the ways that objects in orbit reflect and reinforce power and geopolitics on the ground below. Not offered 2025-26. H/HPS 130. Critical Infrastructures. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. In much of mainstream American culture an enthusiasm for innovation can overshadow the older, established technologies that (often invisibly) sustain society. In this course, we will examine the interplay of environment, technology, and labor that shapes infrastructures and the acts of maintenance that sustain these naturalized systems. We will explore the history and politics of local and regional networks including but not limited to energy, transportation, and information. This course includes site visits and presentations by campus infrastructure experts that help guide our critical encounters with the naturalized technological systems that support daily life and work at Caltech, and which both connect us to and separate us from the surrounding region. Not offered 2025-26. . H/HPS 131. History of Extinction. 9 units (3-0-6); first and third terms. Humans are in the midst of the sixth mass extinction-the first to be caused by human activity. Extinction has been viewed in changing ways over the past 200 years, and this course takes an interdisciplinary approach to learning about the extinction process from a historical as well as a modern perspective. Our focus will be on the extinction of biological entities, but we will also touch on other systems that have disappeared: languages, technologies, habitats, and ways of living. Central to our endeavors will be asking what it means to live in this time of loss: Should we mourn? And if so, how do we mourn for what many or most of us do not see, but only read about? Finally, we will scrutinize what the practical effects of extinction have been, are, and will be. We will also make at least one visit to a natural history museum to view some extinct species behind the scenes. Instructor: Lewis. H/HPS 132. Humanistic Ecology. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. Humans' conceptions of nature have changed dramatically over time. Ecological systems influence human culture, politics, law, and many other spheres, and in turn, humans influence those systems. This class introduces students to the field of humanistic ecology-a discipline that looks to a number of cultural, political, historical and economic elements to better understand the role of ecology in a larger sphere outside of its scientific structure and uses. Humanistic ecology is designed to provide context for the study of ecology, and in a fundamental way, focuses on the appropriate role of humanity in its relationship to nature: what is ethical, or not, what is useful, or not, and a variety of other matters that should be considered when taking a fully three-dimensional view of ecological science. Not offered 2025-26. H/HPS 133. Forests and Humans. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. Forests - which cover 31 percent of the world's land surface - have played essential roles in enhancing the planet's biodiversity. Forests have also served humans in numerous and often controversial ways, and have also been subjected to dramatic change through human activity. How well have we served forests, as well as being served by them? The class will cover the growth and use of forests from a humanistic and historic perspective, as well as discussions about the role of fire in forests, with a particular emphasis on the unprecedented forest fires in California in the past several years and the global ecological implications. Not offered 2025-26. H/HPS 134. Birds, Evolution, Speciation and Society. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. The cultural, scientific, social and political roles of birds make them an excellent lens through which to view humans' interactions with the natural world. This course will cover our changing understandings of birds, starting with hawking and falconry in earlier centuries, through the discovery of new species, up through Darwinian understandings of speciation and evolution, and continuing up to present scientific understandings of birds' capabilities and their ties to humankind, as well as to other anchors in the natural world. We will take a strong biographical as well as avian approach to understanding key personalities who furthered our understandings of avian science. Not offered 2025-26. H 136. Caltech in the Archives. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. This class will introduce students to the methods of archival work in the humanities and social sciences. Over the course of the quarter students will receive an of various types of archives as a background to several small-scale projects working in an archival collection of their own choosing. The seminar will center around weekly projects and synthetic analytical essays about the archival process and archival discoveries. Students hoping to combine their course work with an archive-based research paper may sign up for a separate independent study and conduct research concurrently, with instructor approval. Not offered 2025-26. H 137. Criminals, Outlaws, and Justice in a Thousand Years of Chinese History. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. This course explores the shifting boundary between discourses of crime and disobedience over the last millennium or so of Chinese history. It offers fictional, philosophical, political, propagandistic, official, and personal writings on crime and those who commit it as a basis for a wide-ranging series of discussions about when breaking the law is good, when breaking the law is bad, and who gets to decide where the line between a criminal and an outlaw should be drawn. Not offered 2025-26. H 138. The Way. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. This course introduces students to some of the seminal writings on the meaning of life, the essentials of rulership, and the place of the individual in the universe from the history of Chinese thought and philosophy. Students are given selected readings from several schools of thought in Chinese history, with an emphasis on the formative Warring States era (the period of the Hundred Schools of classical Chinese philosophy). Instead of being asked to write expository or argumentative essays, participants in this seminar will be introduced to analyzing and presenting texts using the method of annotation. Exposure to the principles of annotation will provide students with a new approach to analyzing and talking about texts both within a humanistic context and beyond. Not offered 2025-26. H 139. Translation Theory and Practice (Chinese Historical Sources Seminar). 9 units (3-0-6); first term. This seminar will introduce students to the problems and practices of historical translation for academic purposes, with a focus on primary materials from Chinese history. Students will take responsibility for an individual translation project, participate in seminar discussions and collaborative projects to improve the translations being made, and discuss the philosophical and methodological questions at the heart of the practice of translation. Advanced proficiency in written Chinese is required. Students who write analyses (4,000 words) of the sources being translated may enroll in this class as H 139, which satisfies the advanced humanities credit. Not offered 2025-26. H/L 142. Perspectives on History through Russian Literature. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. The Russian intelligentsia registered the arrival of modern urban society with a highly articulate sensitivity, perhaps because these changes-industrialization, the breakdown of traditional hierarchies and social bonds, the questioning of traditional beliefs-came to Russia so suddenly. This gives their writings a paradigmatic quality; the modern dilemmas that still haunt us are made so eloquently explicit in them that they have served as models for succeeding generations of writers and social critics. This course explores these writings (in English translation) against the background of Russian society, focusing especially on particular works of Chekhov, Dostoevsky, Goncharov, Tolstoy, and Turgenev. Not offered 2025-26. H 149. Age of Fracture: America Since 1974. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. In this course, we will examine America after Richard Nixon's resignation in 1974, a period that historians have referred to as an age of fracture and social disaggregation. Using fracture as a conceptual framework to investigate American politics and culture in the last quarter of the twentieth century, we'll consider how the recent past has informed present-day American society. Themes of study will include the culture wars, political polarization, globalization, and the growing wealth gap. In addition, we'll investigate the theoretical and methodological challenges of doing recent history. Not offered 2025-26. H 152. Where Do We Go from Here? Black America in the Post-Civil Rights Era. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. This course will examine African American politics, culture, and society in the decades following the passage of landmark civil rights legislation in the 1960s. Topics of discussion will include deindustrialization and the rise of hip hop culture, black feminist and queer thought, debates over welfare and affirmative action, and mass incarceration. Analyzing a variety of political and cultural artifacts as well as cutting-edge secondary literature, we will investigate various moments in recent African American history to gain insight into changing notions of rights, citizenship, equality, and freedom in American society. Not offered 2025-26. H/HPS 153. Inequality and Environment. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. This seminar introduces students to the history of environmental inequality, environmental racism, and environmental justice. Human bodies are inescapably enmeshed in our environments: human health and environmental health are inseparable. But environmental burdens and benefits are distributed unevenly along lines of race, gender, class, and nationality. We will examine local, national, and transnational case studies to understand the historical development of environmental inequalities and movements for environmental justice. We will consider different methods for studying environmental injustice and the politics of environmental knowledge. Not offered 2025-26. H/HPS 154. Feminist Science Studies. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. This seminar offers an introduction to scholarship on gender and science. Feminist science studies can seem oxymoronic: the objectivity on which science depends appears opposed to the political commitments feminism implies. Scholars in feminist science studies, however, argue that feminist theory and methods can in fact improve scientific practice. This course will introduce students to the historical development of feminist Science & Technology Studies and what this field tells us about the history of women in science, the history of reading-heavy class will also include discussions of feminist epistemology, feminist research methods, and new directions in feminist STS. Not offered 2025-26. H/HPS 155. Mortality Crises and Social Change: Epidemic Disease from 1300 to the Present. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. What do we know about epidemics in the past? What did contemporaries understand about these events? How did societies respond to periodic bouts of epidemic disease? This course examines mortality crises and epidemics from the Black Death in the 14th century to the current coronavirus pandemic, with attention given to the impact of epidemics on societies, the ways in which such outbreaks have been understood over time and the kinds of responses they have elicited. We will draw on studies for a range of societies in order to identify patterns across space and time, and to highlight both continuity and change in the ways societies have dealt with contagious diseases. Not offered 2025-26. HPS/H 160. Einstein on the Run: European Scientists Fleeing Fascism, War, and the Holocaust. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. Structured around the life and work of Albert Einstein (1879-1955), the course will focus on the 1930s and 1940s, including the discovery of nuclear fission and the making of the atom bomb. Colleagues of Einstein, such as Max Born, Hans Bethe, Enrico Fermi, Lise Meitner, Erwin Schrodinger, and untold numbers of students, scientists, and engineers were forced out of their universities and laboratories by the rise of Fascism in Europe and sought shelter in the United States and elsewhere. Many contributed to the Allied World War II effort. Einstein himself became a facilitator for immigrant scientists, intellectuals, and artists seeking refuge. We shall use historical documents from the Einstein Archives to understand the complex collective and individual experiences and their impact on developments in science and technology during this turbulent historical period. Instructor: Kormos-Buchwald. H 161. Selected Topics in History. 9 units (3-0-6); offered by announcement. This is an advanced humanities course on a specialized topic in History. It is usually taught by new or visiting faculty. The course may be re-taken for credit except as noted in the course announcement. Limited to 15 students. See registrar's announcement for details. Instructors: Staff, visitors. HPS/H 162. Social Studies of Science. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. A comparative, multidisciplinary course that examines the practice of science in a variety of locales, using methods from the history, sociology, and anthropology of scientific knowledge. Topics covered include the high-energy particle laboratory as compared with a biological one; Western as compared to non-Western scientific reasoning; the use of visualization techniques in science from their inception to virtual reality; gender in science; and other topics. Instructor: Feingold. HPS/H 166. Historical Perspectives on the Relations between Science and Religion. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. The course develops a framework for understanding the changing relations between science and religion in Western culture since antiquity. Focus will be on the ways in which the conceptual, personal, and social boundaries between the two domains have been reshaped over the centuries. Questions to be addressed include the extent to which a particular religious doctrine was more or less amenable to scientific work in a given period, how scientific activity carved an autonomous domain, and the roles played by scientific activity in the overall process of secularization. Instructor: Feingold. HPS/H 167. Experimenting with History/Historic Experiment. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. Prerequisites: Ph 1 abc, and Ph 2 abc (may be taken concurrently). This course uses a combination of lectures with hands-on laboratory work to bring out the methods, techniques, and knowledge that were involved in building and conducting historical experiments. We will connect our laboratory work with the debates and claims made by the original discoverers, asking such questions as how experimental facts have been connected to theories, how anomalies arise and are handled, and what sorts of conditions make historically for good data. Typical experiments might include investigations of refraction, laws of electric force, interference of polarized light, electromagnetic induction, or resonating circuits and electric waves. We will reconstruct instrumentation and experimental apparatus based on a close reading of original sources. Not offered 2025-26. HPS/H 168. History of Electromagnetism and Heat Science. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. Prerequisites: Ph 1 abc, and Ph 2 abc (may be taken concurrently). This course covers the development of electromagnetism and thermal science from its beginnings in the early 18th century through the early 20th century. Topics covered include electrostatics, magnetostatics, electrodynamics, Maxwell's field theory, the first and second laws of thermodynamics, and statistical mechanics as well as related experimental discoveries. Not offered 2025-26. HPS/H 169. Selected Topics in the History of Science and Technology. 9 units (3-0-6); This is an advanced humanities course on a specialized topic in HPS and History.

Instructors: Staff, visiting lecturers. HPS/H 170. History of Light from Antiquity to the 20th Century. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. Prerequisites: Ph 1 abc, and Ph 2 abc (may be taken concurrently). A study of the experimental, mathematical, and theoretical developments concerning light, from the time of Ptolemy in the 2nd century A.D. to the production of electromagnetic optics in the 20th century. Instructor: Buchwald. HPS/H 171. History of Mechanics from Galileo through Euler. 9 units (3-0-6); Prerequisites: Ph 1 abc, and Ph 2 abc (may be taken concurrently). This course covers developments in mechanics, as well as the time of Galileo through the middle of the 18th century, which saw the creation of fluid and rotational dynamics in the hands of Euler and others. Not offered 2025-26. HPS/H 172. History of Mathematics: A Global View with Close-ups. 9 units (3-0-6); offered by announcement. The course will provide students with a brief yet adequate survey of the history of mathematics, characterizing the main developments and placing these in their chronological, cultural, and scientific contexts. A more detailed study of a few themes, such as Archimedes' approach to infinite processes, the changing meanings of \"analysis\" in mathematics, Descartes' analytic geometry, and the axiomatization of geometry c. 1900; students' input in the choice of these themes will be welcomed. Not offered 2025-26. HPS/H 175. Matter, Motion, and Force: Physical Astronomy from Ptolemy to Newton. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. The course will examine how elements of knowledge that evolved against significantly different cultural and religious backgrounds motivated the great scientific revolution of the 17th century. Not offered 2025-26. HPS/H 180. Forbidden Knowledge. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. Why does the notion of freedom of knowledge and teaching in science and engineering matter? What kinds of restrictions have been placed on scientists and engineers, their publications and institutions? Who restrained scientific and engineering knowledge of what sorts; for what reasons; and how successfully? These questions will be addressed by exploring the strategies developed by the U.S. research community to protect the international circulation of knowledge after World War II, when scientific freedom and the export of technical data had to be balanced with the needs of national security. Case studies will include the atomic bomb, the semiconductor industry in the 1970s and space technologies, notably rockets/missiles, in the 1990s. The threat to U.S. economics and military security posed by the Soviet Union in the Cold War, and by China today, has transformed the practice of research in university and in industry alike building new walls around the production and circulation of knowledge to affirm national sovereignty that is, all the while, being undermined by the global circulation of trained scientists and engineers. Not offered 2025-26. H/HPS/VC 185. Angels and Monsters: Cosmology, Anthropology, and the Ends of the World. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. This course explores late medieval European understandings of the origins, structure, and workings of the cosmos in the realms of theology, physics, astronomy, astrology, magic, and medicine. Attention is given to the position of humans as cultural creatures at the intersection of nature and spirit; as well as to the place of Christian Europeans in relation to non-Christians and other categories of outsiders within and beyond Europe. We will examine the knowledge system that anticipated racializing theories in the West. Instructor: Wey-Gomez. H/HPS/VC 186. From Plato to Pluto: Maps, Exploration and Culture from Antiquity to the Present. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. This course covers a broad range of topics in the history of maps and exploration from Antiquity to the present. These topics range from the earliest visualizations of earth and space in the Classical world to contemporary techniques in interplanetary navigation. By way of maps, students will explore various ways in which different cultures have conceptualized and navigated earth and space. While maps emulate the world as perceived by the human eye, they, in fact, comprise a set of observations and perceptions of the relationship between bodies in space and time. Thus, students will study maps, and the exploration they enable, as windows to the cultures that have produced them, not only as scientific and technical artifacts to measure and navigate our world. Not offered 2025-26. H/L 191. Perspectives on History through German Literature. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. Industrialization, economic growth, and democracy came to Germany much later than to England and France, and the forms they took in Germany were filtered through the specific institutional character of Central Europe. German-speaking writers and intellectuals saw these trends from the perspective of indigenous intellectual traditions, and the resulting collisions of values and priorities largely shaped European and American social, political, and literary debates for much of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. This course explores these writings (in English translation) against the historical background of Central European society, focusing on particular works of Goethe, Hoffmann, Heine, Nietzsche, Kafka, Rilke, and Mann. Not offered 2025-26. H 192. The Crusades. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. This course will introduce students to the series of religiously motivated European invasions of the Middle and Near East that began at the end of the eleventh century and that led to the creation of Latin Christian principalities in Palestine. Though the crusading movement came to embroil much of Europe itself, the course will focus strictly on the military expeditions to what the Crusaders called the Holy Land, and the history of the Crusader states up to the point of their destruction at the end of the thirteenth century. The course will be guided by the following questions: how did medieval Christianity justify wars of aggression against foreign peoples and religions? What motivated western Europeans to leave their homes and march into a hostile environment, where they often faced impoverishment if not death and where maintaining a Christian presence was a constant struggle? How did they manage to erect stable political entities in alien territory that lasted as long as they did, and how did they have to adapt their own culture to do so? Finally, how did the native peoples of the regions the Crusaders invaded and conquered-Muslim but also Christian and Jewish - perceive the Crusaders? How did the Crusaders' presence affect life in a region whose populations had their own ancient histories and patterns of life? Not offered 2025-26. En/H 193.

Einstein on the Run: European Scientists Fleeing Fascism, War, and the Holocaust. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. Structured around the life and work of Albert Einstein (1879-1955), the course will focus on the 1930s and 1940s, including the discovery of nuclear fission and the making of the atom bomb. Colleagues of Einstein, such as Max Born, Hans Bethe, Enrico Fermi, Lise Meitner, Erwin Schrodinger, and untold numbers of students, scientists, and engineers were forced out of their universities and laboratories by the rise of Fascism in Europe and sought shelter in the United States and elsewhere. Many contributed to the Allied World War II effort. Einstein himself became a facilitator for immigrant scientists, intellectuals, and artists seeking refuge. We shall complex collective and individual experiences and their impact on developments in science and technology during this turbulent historical period. Instructor: Kormos-Buchwald. HPS/H 162.

The course develops a framework for understanding the changing relations between science and religion in Western culture since antiquity. Focus will be on the ways in which the conceptual, personal, and social boundaries between the two domains have been reshaped over the centuries. Questions to be addressed include the extent to which a particular religious doctrine was more or less amenable to scientific work in a given period, how scientific activity carved an autonomous domain, and the roles played by scientific activity in the overall process of secularization. Instructor: Feingold. HPS/H 167. Experimenting with History/Historic Experiment. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. Prerequisites: Ph 1 abc, and Ph 2 abc (may be taken concurrently). This course uses a combination of lectures with hands-on laboratory work to bring out the methods, techniques, and knowledge that were involved in building and conducting historical experiments. We will connect our laboratory work with the debates and claims made by the original discoverers, asking such questions as how experimental facts have been connected to theories, how anomalies arise and are handled, and what sorts of conditions make historically for good data. Typical experiments might include investigations of refraction, laws of electric force, interference of polarized light, electromagnetic induction, or resonating circuits and electric waves. We will reconstruct instrumentation and experimental apparatus based on a close reading of original sources",

In this course we will explore how visual culture shapes our lives and daily experiences, and we will learn to find wonder in its rich details.

Rather than treat these representations as between visual culture and the production of (racialized) knowledge and situates this relationship in a broader global and historical context. We will consider how images shape our 'common sense' ideas about race and its intersections with ability, gender, and sexuality, and explore how race informs what - and how - we see. In addition to reading landmark literature by scholars like Frantz Fanon, bell hooks, Richard Dyer, Edward Said, and Jodi Byrd, students will engage with artists, filmmakers, and activists who work to dismantle what Nicholas Mirzoeff (2023) calls \"white sight\" or the distinctive ways of seeing that characterize white supremacy.

Drawing from the worlds of art and film, advertising and PR, science and technology, politics and propaganda, this course explores what makes certain people, places, and things \"icons.\" To do so, we will first deploy a range of methods for closely analyzing images as signs and symbols, including the practice art historians term \"iconology.\" We will then examine histories of how objects have circulated through culture - from newspapers and magazines to postcards, jpegs, and memes - and thereby become ubiquitous features of everyday experience. Finally, we will consider iconoclasm, the destruction of icons, and the beliefs and logics behind powerful interdictions against visual representation.

In the middle of the seventh century, the tribal followers of a new religion called Islam burst out of the deserts of the Arabian Peninsula and rapidly overwhelmed the armies of the ancient Byzantine and Sassanid Empires. By the middle of the next century, they had conquered much of the western Eurasian world, from the Central Asian steppe to the Straits of Gibraltar. The Muslims' extraordinary achievement bound together lands formerly ruled by two ancient empires-the Roman and Persian-and transformed the cultures, societies, economies, and laws of the diverse peoples now subject to their rule. This course explores the political, social, and institutional history of the Islamicate world from its origins in seventh-century Arabia to the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople in 1453. It will pay particular attention to relations between Islam and the other cultures of the Mediterranean as they are revealed in episodes such as the conquest of Spain, the Crusades, and repeated conflicts with the Byzantine Empire. It will also explore internal political, cultural, and religious conflict among the followers of Islam themselves. Instructor: Morgan",

Most of the music we encounter can be thought of as the organization of a very limited set of tones into distinct patterns of repetition, and it has been this way for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. And yet, music has come to mean infinitely more than its sonic surface: we study great works of music like we do great works of literature and art; we use our musical preferences to convey our social and political identities; we expect - and technology has enabled - our public and private spaces to be saturated in music; and certain musical works possess such power that they are sometimes altered, if not banned outright. But how has music acquired all of these meanings? How does it communicate? What is it that we are listening to when we are listening to music? In addition to serving as an introduction to the academic study of music, this course aims to deepen our musical appreciation and understanding by critically examining listening habits of the past and present. Knowledge of Western music notation and harmony is helpful but not required; the basics will be reviewed as needed. Not offered 2025-26",

How did the likes of Singer, John Deere and Seth Thomas - latecomers to the markets they served-come to dominate those markets both domestically and internationally? Why did the technology of interchangeable parts and mass production become known as 'the American system' when much of that technology was imported from Europe? What role did government play in facilitating or thwarting innovation and economic growth? This course will explore such questions as reflected in the ordinary things people collect under the label 'antiques'. What do we learn from the fact that we can document a half dozen American manufacturers of apple peelers but not a single comparable European company? Why is the hand sewn quilt a nearly unique American folk art form and what does the evolution of quilting patterns tell us about technology and economic prosperity? What do baking powder cans as a category of collectible tell us about the politics of federal versus state regulation? Students will be expected to each choose a topic that asks such questions and to explore possible answers, all with an eye to understanding the interplay of economics, politics, and demography.

Its negative effects on society are clear, and many voters and political elites agree that unchecked partisan polarization causes harm to our democratic institutions. Yet, it also feels like these social divisions are not improving anytime soon. If most people agree that Republicans and Democrats just need to get along, then why are we still so divided by partisanship? Why did this divide emerge in the first place? And if polarization is a defining problem of American politics today, what can be done to alleviate or at least mitigate its effects? This course will explore these questions by discussing relevant literature on American political parties, voter partisanship, and partisan polarization. Through reading a mix of academic research as well as political and cultural journalism, students will learn more about the history of the modern Democratic and Republican parties; trends in voter behavior and partisanship, including how partisanship varies across different subgroups of voters; and recent research on the causes and consequences of modern partisan polarization. By the end of the course, students will have an improved understanding of American partisanship and how it impacts many of today's most pressing policy issues",

We will study the differential impact of these political institutions on the type of policies they implement and the economic outcomes they produce. The main objective of the course will be to assess the robustness of the analyzed theories in light of their empirical support, coming mainly from statistical analysis",

An examination of the impact of Buddhism on the arts and cultures of India, Southeast Asia, China, Korea, and Japan from its earliest imagery in the 4th century B.C.E. India through various doctrinal transformations to the Zen revival of 18th-century Japan. Select monuments of Buddhist art, including architecture, painting, sculpture, and ritual objects, will serve as focal points for discussions on their aesthetic principles and for explorations into the religious, social, and cultural contexts that underlie their creation.

Snow famously dubbed the \"two cultures\"-the sciences and the humanities-with an emphasis on forms and practices of visual culture that blur the boundaries between science, technology, and art. What role, we will ask, have visual culture and visuality played in the construction of scientific knowledge? Taking a broad historical and geographical approach, we will explore topics including representations of science and technology in the arts and popular culture; the use of photography, illustration, and visualization in the sciences; histories of visuality and visual devices; and the everyday visual practices of scientific inquiry.

Social media feeds are flooded with clickbait headlines like \"13 Queer Superheroes We Need to See\" and \"Disney's Ariel is Black and People are MAD!\" Everywhere, debates about equity and transformation seem to turn on a single phrase: \"Representation matters!\" But how does representation matter, why does it matter, and when did it come to matter most? Pushing beyond competing narratives of 'wokeness' and 'inclusion', this course thinks through representation as a uniquely visual formula for social change with its own history, assumptions, and limitations. Working at nested scales from national controversies (like an all-female Ghostbusters) to local case studies (like East Hollywood's Flavors From Afar, with its roster of refugee chefs), students will study efforts to increase visibility and institutionalize diversity across cultural contexts, and explore how communities, in turn, challenge and transform identities prescribed for them.

Histories of photography typically begin with the invention of the camera in 19th century France, highlighting the key figures, movements, and themes of a Western art form. At best, the Global South is an addendum to this narrative - a place photography happens to, rather than a site of visual innovation. Taking an alternative approach to the canon, this course centers non-Western image cultures in the history and theorization of the medium, following the camera as it travels from the studios of colonial bureaucrats in Rajasthan through the struggle against South African apartheid to Tunisia's smartphone revolution. Adopting a global and comparative lens, students will read classic works of photographic theory alongside anticolonial philosophy, fiction, and art manifestos, exploring how a familiar medium has been repeatedly re-imagined and re-invented to suit new contexts and meet new needs. Ultimately, we'll ask how widening our field of view can expand our understanding of photography, shifting how we read images more broadly. Not offered 2025-26",
