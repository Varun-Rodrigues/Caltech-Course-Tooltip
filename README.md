## License

This project is created for educational purposes as part of the Caltech student experience. Course data is sourced from official Caltech publications.

Let me explain how the Google Docs functionality works in your extension. I'll break down the technical implementation and user experience:

🔍 Google Docs Functionality Explained
📝 How It Works Technically
1. Document Detection
2. Google Docs Loading Process
3. Complex DOM Structure Handling
Google Docs has a unique, complex DOM structure that's different from regular web pages:

4. Real-time Content Monitoring
👨‍🎓 User Experience
What Users See:
Opening a Google Doc:

Extension automatically detects it's a Google Doc
Console shows: 📝 Initializing Google Docs support
Waits for document to fully load
Viewing Course Codes:

Any course code in the document (like "CS 156" or "Ma 3") gets highlighted
Hovering shows the same tooltip as on regular webpages
Works with typed text, pasted content, and shared documents
Real-time Updates:

As users type new course codes, they're detected immediately
When collaborators add course codes, they're also detected
Works with document edits, comments, and suggestions
Supported Google Services:
Service	URL Pattern	What It Does
Google Docs	docs.google.com/document/	Live document editing with course detection
Google Drive Viewer	drive.google.com/file/	Viewing documents stored in Drive
Shared Documents	Any Google Docs share link	Works on documents shared with you
⚡ Why This Is Challenging
1. Dynamic Content Loading
Google Docs loads content dynamically as you scroll
Text is rendered in complex nested <div> structures
Content changes without page reloads
2. Complex DOM Structure
3. Performance Considerations
Must not interfere with Google Docs' own functionality
Needs to handle frequent DOM changes efficiently
Should work on large documents without slowing down
🎯 Smart Features
1. Collaborative Support
Detects course codes added by other users in real-time
Works during live collaborative editing sessions
Handles comments and suggestions containing course codes
2. Document Types Supported
New Documents: Blank docs you create
Shared Documents: Docs others share with you
Template Documents: Google Docs templates
Imported Documents: Word docs converted to Google Docs
3. Editing Modes
Editing Mode: Full detection while you type
Viewing Mode: Detection in read-only documents
Suggestion Mode: Works with suggested text changes
🔧 Technical Challenges Solved
1. Timing Issues
2. Content Changes
3. Multiple Document Formats
📋 Limitations & Considerations
Current Limitations:
Loading Delay: May take 1-2 seconds to activate on large documents
Heavy Documents: Very long documents might have slight performance impact
Offline Mode: Requires internet connection for initial load
Future Improvements Possible:
Faster detection algorithms
Better integration with Google Docs' API
Support for Google Sheets course references
Integration with Google Classroom
🧪 Testing the Functionality
To test Google Docs support:

Create a test document: Go to docs.google.com
Type course codes: Add text like "I'm taking CS 156 and Ma 3 this term"
Hover over codes: Should see tooltips with course information
Try collaborative editing: Share with someone and have them add course codes
Test different formats: Try "ACM 95/100" or "ESE/Ge 142"
The Google Docs functionality essentially makes your extension work seamlessly across Caltech's most commonly used document platform, ensuring students can get course information no matter where they encounter course codes! 📚
